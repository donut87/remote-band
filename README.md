# Problem
Corona obviously

# Solution
## First ideas
 - Skype
 - discord
 - ...

Do not work because of latency. But latency is build in as a feature!

## Possible Softwares
- ninjam -> complex
- JamKazam -> now paid version
- Jamulus -> ended up using this
- Bandlab -> does too much and you have to register
- eJamming -> Also registration... meh

### April
- Starting with JamKazam
- but without a drummer
  - did not have the gear to play with us

### May
- Continuing

### June through September/October
- Back in rehearsal room

### November
- Back with JamKazam
- it now sucks
  - Microfone from one of us, no longer works (robo/darth vader sounds)
  - loses settings from week to week (one gets really skilled in setting this up)

### December
- JamKazam still sucks
- but now a monetization is announced
  - we are not happy
- fiddling with Jamulus and the public servers
  - but public servers are... yeah... public...
  - Solution: Host server at home (raspi or other dedicated pc)
  - Problem: Default routers from ISP are shitty
  - Next idea: Let's rent a vServer
    - works!
    - latency: 35ms default Ubuntu 20.04
    - low latency kernel: 25ms
